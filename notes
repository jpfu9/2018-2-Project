* Mixed Neighbourhoods. 
* Interesting if energy infrastructure can be include. 

* How this is different from an LCA assessment? 	
		* It gives the detail in time, yes. 
		* LCA, cant analyse things evolving in time and chnages/improvements in technology, nor flows every year. 
		*

Abstract:
	- How a sustainable N should be designed, and what information is required to plan and design it?
	- Dynamic BS model to analyse E and GHGs. 
	- Can be used to model any N where BS data is available.
		- uses description of current stock, plans for construction, demolition and renovation activities.
		- BS divided in archetypes (cohort, ren state and floor area class)
	- Hourly energy demand is estimated - requires e intensity profiles given for archetypes of buildings and empirical data. 
	- Different energy carriers and purposes can be define and estimate in different time resolutions, this to estimate energy demand and emissions.
